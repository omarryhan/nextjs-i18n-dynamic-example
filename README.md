# Next.JS i18n Example

## Features

- In the spirit of React, instead of declaring all translations in a global `locales` folder, each component and page has its own set of translations. Each translation dir is placed under: `/public/translations/` by default. So, translations for `components/Title` component, will be found under: `/public/translations/components/Title`, for `components/Nested/NestedComponent` will be found under `/public/translations/Nested/NestedComponent` and `pages/[language]/page-2` will be found under `public/translations/pages/[language]/page-2`

- SEO as a top priority

  - Adds hreflang tags for you
  - Sets HTML lang attribute for you

- Doesn't block Next.js Automatic Static Optimizations.

- RTL and custom direction

- Works with next export. (You'll only have to remove the `getServerSideProps` function in `pages/index.js` and rely only on the client side redirect or create one yourself on your HTTP server)

- Support for both: server loaded translations and dynamic translations

- Dynamic translations are cahched using a stale while revlidate cache strategy (using Vercel's [SWR lib](https://github.com/vercel/swr)), so that only the first load will result in a delay.

## Don't use if

- If you don't want to maintain the all the i18n logic yourself.

- Don't want to write a lot of boilerplate

- If you don't want to use HTTP subdirectory based i18n. e.g. `https://example.com/en/about`

## Files

### 0. `i18n.config.ts`

Example config:

```TS
const allLanguages: Config = {
  en: {
    name: 'English',
    prefix: 'en',
  },
  ar: {
    name: 'العربية',
    prefix: 'ar',
    direction: 'rtl',
  },
};

const defaultLanguage: Language = allLanguages.en;

// used for setting the `hreflang` alternate tag.
// Read the withI18n section for more info.
const domains: Domains = {
  development: 'http://localhost:3000',
  production: 'https://next-i18n-dynamic.netlify.app',
};

export default {
  allLanguages,
  defaultLanguage,
  domains
}
```

### 1. `pages/_document.tsx`

Is only there to add the `lang` property in the `html` tag. Note: due to a limitation of Next.JS, the lang property won't change during client side language transitions because the document object is only rendered on the server. For client side html lang transitions, check: `changeDocumentLanguage`.

### 2. `pages/_app.tsx`

Is there to:

1. add a `div` with a `dir` property. e.g. `rtl` and `ltr`. You should define the direction of the languages you specify in `i18n.config.ts`.

2. Set the preferred-language cookie with the language found in context (Defaults to a 100 year cookie).

3. Makes sure the `<html>` lang property is changed if the language changes.

### 3. `utils/i18n.tsx`

**Has:**

#### `getI18nStaticPaths`

Enumerates `getStaticPaths` with all the lanugage prefixes that you define in your config.

#### `getI18nProps`

Should be used for: `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`.

A simple function that given the language param code generated by: `getI18nStaticPaths` and the component translations needed, loads:

- The language prefix. Returns the default language if no language prefix was given (Shouldn't normally happen).

- The translation namespaces specified, from `public/translations` into memory.

There are two way you can load the translations:

1. Specify the paths you want to load like in: `pages/dynamic.tsx` and `pages/page-2.tsx` (More performant, but a bit annoying)

2. Pass the function Node's fs module to make it recurse over all the translations in the `tranlationsDir` you specify and loads them in context. (Less performant, but way less annoying).

Personally, I find that the convenience of method no.2 overweighs the performance gains of method no.1. I recommend starting with method no.2. And if after a while, using method 2 becomes a huge performance bottleneck, switch to method no.1.

#### `withI18n`

Wraps all the pages that use the `getI18nProps` method. It accepts the props passed by `getI18nProps` and sets them in the `i18nContext` so that all your components can access them using the `useI18n` hook.

This HOC also adds an `hreflang` alternate tag given the page route, e.g.

If you pass the page in `pages/page-2.tsx` to this HOC like this:

```TS
export default withI18n(Page, '/page-2');
```

It will add the following links to your header.

```jsx
  <link
    rel="alternate"
    href={`http://localhost:3000/en/${pathname}`}  // pathname is '/page-2' in that case
    hrefLang="en"
  />
```

This tag is used to tell search engines which pages are translations of which pages. This is needed because Google claims that the Google crawler doesn't understand path-directories/sub-domains in regards to how they relate to a page's language. (Anyway, stop lying to us Google. We all know that your bots have super intellegence and will be ruling us only in a matter of years).

#### `useI18n`

A hook that given a translation path, returns the translations needed along with:

- the current language prefix
- the current language configs

#### `useDynamicI18n`

Asynchronously loads the translations by doing an ajax call. This will be moved to `useDynamicI18n`. And this will be used to return the proper translations from context. Check: ***components/DynamicTranslations*** for an example.

#### `withPrefetchDynamicTranslations`

To be used with `useDynamicI18n`

A HOC to wrap components that use the `useDynamicI18n` hook. Adds a prefetch header so that the user doesn't have to wait for the component to mount in order to download the translations. This however doesn't entirely solve the latency issue because your page won't show the translations until the components actually mount. That's because SWR can only access the prefetched version when the component mounts and the all the JS has been loaded. This can be useful for large translations and large XHR requests in general. But given the atomicity of the translations in this example, it probably won't make much difference in the latency anyway, because the major latency bottleneck is React, not the translations. NOTE: link prefetch is neither supported on Safari nor Safari IOS.

#### `Link`

Wraps next/link and accepts these extra props:

- language: string of which language you want to redirect to.
- href is optional. If you only pass a language without an href, this link will only switch to the language you chose.

A side effect of this component is that it changes the document's language, when clicked, to the language it redirected to.

Note: Mostly borrowed from next-translate. I would've imported it if it weren't for the fact that next-js call their own hook from within this component.

#### `changeDocumentLanguage`

Given a language prefix on the browser, sets it to \<html>'s lang attribute. Use when changing langugaes. `Link` automatically handles that for you.

#### `setI18nCookie`

Sets a cookie with a name of: `preferred-language` to your cookies. Only works in the browser. See `pages/[language]/index.tsx` to see how this cookie is loaded on the server.

#### `getI18nAgnosticPathname`

Strips the language directory prefix from `window.location.pathname` and returns it. Only works on the browser

#### `getLanguageFromURL`

Opposite of `changeDocumentLanguage`. Strips the language prefix from `window.location.pathname` and returns it. Only works on the browser

## Pain points

1. It's quite cumbersome to list the names of the translations needed for each page. Since all pages already knows which components they will mount, we should expect them to know which translations to load without needing to specify them. I can't think of a clean workaround to solve this problem. Please let me know your thoughts.

2. Redirecting from '/' to '/ar' or '/en' is easy. But what if the user goes to '/page-2' and not '/ar/page-2'. Imo, it should treat it like '/' does and not return a 404.

3. If we solve point #2, we can automatically detect the user's preferred language on the browser, using the browser's `navigator.languages`. It's not worth doing this on '/' if you ask me.

## Notes

- At first, I tried to store all the translations, in the directory of their respective component, instead of the current approach (which is having an identical component and pages tree in the `/public` directory). I switched to the current approach due to:

  - **Dynamically** importing JSON files as opposed to fetching them via XHR returned a webpack JS module instead of a simple JSON file. This means more payload size. :thumbs-down:. I'm not sure why this was happening, is it a Typescript thing? No clue.

  - I found it hard to dynamically (on the browser) import JSON files using a helper that's located in another directory. e.g. with the `useDynamicI18n` hook, I tried passing it the `__dirname` of the component from the component, but apparantly this feature [isn't](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#reading-files-use-processcwd) [yet](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/8251) [supported](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10943) by Next.JS. AFAIR, `__dirname` always returned an empty string. Tl;Dr I can't think of a way to dynamically import translations found in the folder of the component. from a helper module, e.g. `utils/i18n.ts`.

  - I was thinking of returning the translations back in the folder of their respective component. That way when you refactor your components (Move the components around your components dir), you won't have to sync the translations tree. However, one downside is that you'll have to rename all the refactored components. On the other hand, where do we keep the translations of /pages?

- Using next canary release because they fixed the (bug)? where a trailing slash in the URL throws an error. To make all pages use a trailing slash, in your `next.config.js`, add:

```js
  experimental: {
    trailingSlash: true
  }
```
